A long time ago I created a bunch of training materials relative to DataStax Enterprise.

   .  DSE -- Core, was effectively Apache Cassandra

   .  DSE -- Search, was efectively Solr/Lucene

   .  DSE -- Analytics, was effectively Spark
 
   .  DSE -- Graph, was effectively Apache Tinkerpop/Gremlin
